Hi There, I Made This To Answer This Discussion At microsoft's WSL Github Repo: [https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/6540](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/6540) And for The Person That Made It, [@FalloutZone](https://github.com/FalloutZone), I Hope This Helps You!

## What Is This?

WSBSD (Windows Subsystem for BSD) is a project that aims to provide a BSD-like environment on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and other tools.

FreeBSD Is Only Available For WSBSD, But More BSD Distros Will Be Added In The Future. (As Of 5/22/2025)
