Hi There, I Made This To Answer This Discussion At microsoft's WSL Github Repo: [https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/6540](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/6540) And for The Person That Made It, [@FalloutZone](https://github.com/FalloutZone), I Hope This Helps You!

## What Is This?

WSBSD (Windows Subsystem for BSD) is a project that aims to provide a BSD-like environment on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and other tools.
